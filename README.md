# Set up envirment

First make sure that you have node.js installed
(Look up how to do this for your operating system)

### $ npm install

If it completes with no errors you are ready to go!
(You should also now have a node_modules directory in the project.
This stays on your local machine and is not synced with git.)

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

### $ npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### $ npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" to your `snowpack.config.js` config file.

### $ npm test

Launches the application test runner.
Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.
